            Some Intresting Facts About Origami
     <br><br>
          <p>  Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). 
            Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). 
            An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
